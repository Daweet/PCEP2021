    "### 1. Analysis stage \n",
    "In this stage we determine the requirements like variables, functions, etc. to solve the problem. That means we collect the necessary resources to solve the problem at hand. In this phase we identify the problem, divide solve each subunits, and lastly regroup the solutions as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Plan \n",
    "During this phase, we develop a step by step procedure to solve the problem using the specification given in the previous phase. This stage is cruicial as we write the solution in step by step statements. This step includes IPO (Input Process Output) and Algorithm.\n",

    "### 3. Coding stage \n",
    "This phase uses a programming language to write or implement the actual programming instructions for the steps defined in the previous phase. It is in this phase that we build the actual program. That means we write the program to solve the given problem using programming languages of our preferences such as Python, C, C++, Java, etc.,\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Testing stage\n",
    "Reminding ourselves of the moto GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) it is advisable to check whether our code (written in the previous step) is actually solving the specified problem or not. That means we test the program whether it is solving the problem for various input data values or not. It is actually crucial to see whethere the code is doing what we want it to do. You need to conduct unit test (test each code), system test (test the entire code), and  integration test (will it work for different platforms such as Mac, Windows, iPad, Mobile etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Maintenance\n",
    "During this phase, the program is actively used by the users. In this phase, the solution (program) is used by the end-user. If the user encounters any problem or wants any improvement, then we need to repeat all the phases from the starting, so that the encountered problem is solved. This stage involves fixing bugs (if any), add features for enhancement, and document every change you made. "
